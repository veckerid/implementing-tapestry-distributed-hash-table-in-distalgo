Tapestry is a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network that provides high-performance, scalable, and location-independent routing of messages to close-by endpoints, using only localized resources. The focus on routing brings with it a desire for efficiency: minimizing message latency and maximizing message throughput.
Thus, for instance, Tapestry exploits locality in routing messages to mobile endpoints such as object replicas; this behavior is in contrast to other structured P2P overlay networks. It uses adaptive algorithms with soft state to maintain fault tolerance in the face of changing node membership and network faults. In this project, we'll implement a simulation of Tapestry DHT algorithm (as mentioned in http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Foceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu%2Fpublications%2Fpapers%2Fpdf%2FSPAA02.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfbHI_B86WFnMOIFc3SRkp_zRVPag)
